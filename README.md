Snoopy is a character from Charles M. Schulz's imagination that first aired on our televisions last October 4, 1950. A not-so-average beagle that is loved by many because of his admirable traits and his cute appearance. Plus, like his creator, his imagination is broad that keeps his life away from bore though his uncountable adventures. 

**"Snoopy’s whole personality is a little bittersweet. But he’s a very strong character. He can win or lose, be a disaster, a hero, or anything, and yet it all works out. I like the fact that when he’s in real trouble, he can retreat into a fantasy." —Charles M. Schulz**
